# Insurance Policy

## About

This Project contains the smart contracts for Insurance Policy deployed on the Sepolia testnet.
In this insurance policy smart contract built with Solidity, there are two main entities: the policyholder and the insurer.
    1) The policyholder is the person or entity purchasing the insurance to get financial protection against potential risks or losses. 
    2) The insurer, on the other hand, is the company providing the insurance coverage in exchange for a premium paid by the policyholder. 
    3) The smart contract automates the agreement between these two parties, ensuring that claims are processed and payments are made according to the predefined terms, all without the need for intermediaries. This creates a transparent, efficient, and tamper-proof insurance process.
